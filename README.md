# Particle Adaptive Importance Sampling for Regime-Switching State-Space Models

## Summary
This repository contains an implementation of a particle adaptive importance sampling (PAIS) method for the 
Bayesian analysis of regime-switching state-space models. The software implementation can be utilized to study general 
Bayesian models - all that is required is that the user supplies a method to compute unbiased estimates of the 
likelihood function. This particular software implementation focuses on regime-switching state-space models. The 
algorithm is applied to analyze the population dynamics of Ad√©lie penguins through both synthetic data and real data 
collected from a public database.
