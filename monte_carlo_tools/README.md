# Monte Carlo Methods 

### Pareto-Smoothed Importance Sampling
In order to perform more efficient inference, we utilize a method for smoothing the importance sampling weights called
_Pareto smoothed importance sampling_ (PSIS, see this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02646) ). A thorough 
implementation of PSIS can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/avehtari/PSIS).
