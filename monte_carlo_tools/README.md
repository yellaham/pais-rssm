# Monte Carlo Methods 

## Adaptive Importance Sampling

### Stochastic Gradient Update Rules 

### Warm-up for Sampler

### Temporal Deterministic Mixture Weights

### Pareto-Smoothed Importance Sampling
In order to perform more efficient inference, we utilize a method for smoothing the importance sampling weights called
_Pareto smoothed importance sampling_ (PSIS, see this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02646)). A thorough 
implementation of PSIS can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/avehtari/PSIS).

## Stochastic Filtering

### Bootstrap Particle Filtering

### Bootstrap Regime-Switching Particle Filtering
